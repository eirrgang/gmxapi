# Brief release notes

The gmxapi 0.0.7 C++ API, defined by GROMACS 2019, is incompatible with gmxapi 0.0.6.

Note that version compatibility in ``find_package`` is handled by the installed
cmake version file of the targeted package, including handling of the `EXACT`
key word, but the CMake macros used in gromacs-gmxapi should take care of this.

See docs/changelog.rst and https://github.com/kassonlab/gmxapi for more information.

The gmxapi 0.0.7 Python package is the final release of gmxapi in its own repository.
Ongoing gmxapi development is entirely within the GROMACS repository or its forks.
