Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bug fix for the GPU version of LINCS in multiple domain case
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Increase in the maximum number of coupled constraints in the
domain did not trigger memory re-allocation, which is now fixed.
This can happen, e.g. when big molecule enters the domain, previously
occupied by smaller molecules. The bug does not affect the single
domain case.

Fix index handling of N-body virtual sites with domain decomposition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Incorrect indexing would be used to handle N-body virtual sites in
the domain decomposition code. This would usually lead to crashes
due to illegal or incorrect memory usage.

:issue:`3635`

Fix assertion failure with LJ-PME and dispersion correction
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With vdw-type=PME and dispersion correction, mdrun would exit with
an assertion failure during PME tuning.

:issue:`3677`

Bug fix for FEP calculations with modular simulator and domain decomposition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
When using the modular simulator, domain decomposition and free energy
calculations with perturbed masses, the simulation would always be
performed using the masses at lambda=0 instead of the actual lambda value.

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix default output with gmx trjcat -demux
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Files would not be written when using default file name output.

:issue:`3653`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CUDA 11.0 supported
"""""""""""""""""""

A build with CUDA 11.0 now configures and passes tests.
Building with CUDA 11.0 means that hardware with CC 3.0 is no longer supported,
while CC 8.0 can now be used.

:issue:`3632`

Fix building with MSVC
""""""""""""""""""""""

The build would fail due to a missing header.

:issue:`3669`

Only check for RDTSCP on x86 platforms
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix crash of grompp when the whole system is frozen
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When the whole system would be frozen, grompp would crash with
a segmentation fault.

:issue:`3683`

Fixes the unexpected change in molecule indexing in output after simulation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Molecule indices of repeat molecules are now again numbered consecutively as
expected (instead of all ``1``).

:issue:`3575`

Fix ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` for ``libgromacs`` CMake target
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:file:`libgromacs.cmake` was malformed, referencing non-existent directories.

:issue:`3592`
