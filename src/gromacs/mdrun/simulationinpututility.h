/*! \brief Get the global simulation input.

 * Acquire global simulation data structures from the SimulationInput handle.
 * Note that global data is returned in the calling thread. In parallel
 * computing contexts, the client is responsible for calling only where needed.
 *
 * Example:
 *    if (SIMMASTER(cr))
 *    {
 *        // Only the master rank has the global state
 *        globalState = globalSimulationState(simulationInput);
 *
 *        // Read (nearly) all data required for the simulation
 *        applyGlobalInputRecord(simulationInput, inputrec);
 *        applyGlobalTopology(simulationInput, &mtop);

/*! \brief Initialize local stateful simulation data.
 *
 * Establish an invariant for the simulator at a trajectory point.
 * Call on all ranks (after domain decomposition and task assignments).
 *
 * After this call, the simulator has all of the information it will
 * receive in order to advance a trajectory from the current step.
 * Checkpoint information has been applied, if applicable, and stateful
 * data has been (re)initialized.
 *
 * \warning It is the callerâ€™s responsibility to make sure that
 * preconditions are satisfied for the parameter objects.
